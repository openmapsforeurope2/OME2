# User guide for the production of the AU (Administrative units) theme

## Step 1: model conversion
When a new AU dataset is received for a country, the first step consists in implementing the model conversion parameter file, then launch the model conversion itself.
See [add link]
As a result, the administrative tables for each relevant level for the country will be filled:
* au.administrative_unit_area_1
* au.administrative_unit_area_2
* au.administrative_unit_area_3
* au.administrative_unit_area_4
* au.administrative_unit_area_5
* au.administrative_unit_area_6

## Step 2: generate OME2 international boundaries with neighbouring countries


## Step 3: edge-match administrative units at the lowest level


## Step 4: edge-match administrative units at all other levels
